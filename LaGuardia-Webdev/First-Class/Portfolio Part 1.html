	<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

	<p>My name is Joan Eugene and I have had a fascination with computers from a young age. I attended High School of Computer and Technology where I obtained my regents diploma. I have always had fascination technology. Now I am pursing what I want to do. <p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>I graduated from Monroe College with my Associates from Monroe College.After, I attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice and recieved my Bachelors of Science. One of my goals are to ultimately merge the two fields together. There are so many oppurtunties where you can incorporate web development into any field that may interest you.</p>

<p>I have worked at John Jay College as a Public Safety Officer and also as an adminstrative assistant for the Mcnair Program. The Mcnair Scholars are honor students so it inspired me to be around an enviroment.It was great because I was going to school fulltime and this gave me the flexibility to stay in an environment where I can study and be able to meet others who are on the same page.</p>

<h3>Hobbies </h3>

<p>One of the things I like to do in my free time is travel. I love meeting new people and enjoying nothing but postive energy. I traveled to a diffrent country by myself and it was an amazing experience. 
	<br>
We have one life to live so I am planning on living it to the fullest</p>
