		<!-- This is Css the styling you put it in the head this changes and makes borders. Displayed is 10px which makes the border of the blcok appear bigger as 3px is smaller

		This shows us the difference between putting Css in block and inline elements. Looking at the heading <h1> is thicker and takes the whole row as opposed to <span> which stops when the word stops -->

	<p>Block elements default to having a new line before and after the element while filling all the available horizontal space of the parent element that contains them. By contrast, inline elements do not start with a new line nor do they fill the entirety of the horizontal space of the parent. An inline element can begin and end at any point within a line.

Inline elements allow for specific styling to small portions of text or the application of functional components within the broader scope of the parent element they are contained within.

We will examine the <span></span> element to demonstrate how we can use it to style a small portion of our content.
